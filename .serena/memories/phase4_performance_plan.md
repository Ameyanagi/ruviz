# Phase 4: Performance Optimization Plan

## Current Status
- Box plots, histograms, and seaborn themes completed
- Subplot functionality working
- Several optimization test failures (non-critical)

## Performance Features to Implement:
1. **Memory Optimization Demo** - Show buffer pooling and memory efficiency
2. **Parallel Rendering Demo** - Multi-threaded rendering for large datasets  
3. **SIMD Processing Demo** - Vectorized operations for numerical computation
4. **DataShader Integration** - Large dataset aggregation (100k+ points)
5. **Scientific Plotting Example** - Publication-quality multi-panel figures

## Implementation Priority:
1. Memory optimization (fix buffer pooling issues)
2. Parallel rendering (leverage existing parallel.rs)
3. DataShader for large datasets
4. SIMD optimizations
5. Scientific plotting showcase

## Files to Work With:
- src/data/memory.rs (buffer pooling fixes)
- src/render/parallel.rs (multi-threading)
- src/data/datashader.rs (large dataset handling)
- examples/memory_optimization_demo.rs (new)
- examples/parallel_demo.rs (new)
- examples/simd_demo.rs (new)
- examples/scientific_plotting.rs (new)
